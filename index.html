                <p>The Heart and Soul Foundation solely exists to serve the community, especially the disadvantaged
                    children,
                    with the help of our donors and sponsors. To do this in a sustainable manner, we believe in
                    excellent
                    communication, leadership and human relations.</p>

                <p> Through our different programs we will ensure the growth of individuals, participation, and pride in
                    the
                    community.</p>

                <p>At the Heart and Soul Foundation, we recognize the significance of providing meals for both our
                    preschool
                    and after-school children, as well as the wider community. Our commitment is to ensure that basic
                    needs
                    are
                    met daily. We are also committed to supporting individuals in their job search, empowering them
                    towards
                    upwards mobility and growth.</p>

                <p>Our focus will also be on the elderly population in our community, specifically those residing in old
                    age
                    homes. We understand that older individuals face unique challenges and have distinct needs. As such,
                    we
                    will
                    conduct regular evaluations of our programs for the elderly to ensure their specific needs are met
                    effectively.</p>

                <p>Whenever necessary, professionals from the community will provide counseling services to individuals
                    who
                    require support for issues related to substance abuse, gender-based violence, and family matters</p>

                <p>Together we will make a difference.</p>
